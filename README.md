This repository was for use during the shadowship/internship. To see the main project, go to the game directory.

A two week, 8-10 hour a day internship. I worked on a team of two and learned a lot of the basics of HTML, Javascript, and CSS, as well as their relation to web design. We also learned about networks, servers, and realtime systems. We then went through the process of developing a web based, multiplayer game using socket.io.

The game can be ran using socket.io. Install the proper packages (express, node.js, socket.io) and when run, you should be able to play the game in browser by going to 'localhost'. 

The game was originally on it's own server, but was taken down for monetary purposes.
